Children
--------
Children belonging to Participants.  The Participant registering the child must be the 
child's parent or legal guardian.  A Child can only belong to one Participant.

Demographic Data
----------------
When Participants create accounts on Lookit, they are asked to fill out a demographic survey. Demographic Data is versioned, so if Participants update their
Demographic Data, a new version is saved. When Participants take part in a study, the latest version of Demographic Data is linked to their study Response.

Experimenter
------------
Application where Researchers develop Studies, request to post Studies to Lookit, and access data collected.

Feedback
--------
Researchers can leave Feedback to Participants via the API about a particular Response to a Study.  The Participant can view this Feedback on the Past Studies page.

Groups
------
Each Lab and each Study will have one group for each role: lab Admins, Members, and Guests, 
and Study Design, Preview, Researcher, Submission processor, etc. 
Groups are an easy way to manage many permissions. These groups will be created 
automatically when a Lab or Study is created. Researchers belonging to any of these groups
will inherit all of the associated permissions.

Lab
------------
A research group that uses Lookit. Each Lab can have its own admins, members, and guests, 
and can manage its own lab membership. Each Study is associated with exactly one Lab; only 
researchers who are part of that Lab can be added as collaborators on the Study. Researchers
can belong to multiple Labs.

Participants
------------
Account holders - registered Lookit users who can take part in studies. 'Participant' 
refers to the account (generally held by a parent) rather than the individual child. 

Researchers
-----------
Individuals posting Studies, collecting data, or administering Lookit.

Responses
---------
When a Participant takes part in a study, the answers to their questions, as well as 
other metadata like the time taking the study, are saved in a Response.  In addition,
many Responses are associated with videos.

Study
------
An experiment that can be posted to Lookit.
