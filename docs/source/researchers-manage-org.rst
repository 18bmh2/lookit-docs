Managing your Organization
##################################


Currently all researchers using Lookit are part of a single 'MIT' organization. The organization construct will eventually allow labs to manage access for their own students and RAs. For now, though, these instructions just apply to Lookit admins. 

-----------------------------------------
Adding researchers to your organization
-----------------------------------------

Navigate to `Manage Organization` https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/researchers/.  Only users with organization admin and organization read permissions can view other researchers in the org. 
The researchers displayed are researchers that currently belong to your organization, or researchers still needing approval.  Researchers awaiting approval have "No organization groups" listed as the permission.
Navigate to a researcher awaiting approval (only organization admins are permitted to do this).

Under permissions at the bottom of the researcher detail page, select `Researcher`, `Organization Read`, or `Organization Admin` from the dropdown, and click the check mark.  This will give
that researcher the associated permissions and add them to your organization. They will receive an email notification.

Editing a researcher's organization permissions
------------------------------------------------
Navigate to a particular researcher's detail page https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/researchers/<researcher_id>.  Only organization admins can view this page. Under permissions at the bottom of the researcher detail page, select `Researcher`, `Organization Read`, or `Organization Admin` from the dropdown, and click the check mark.  This will modify
the researcher's permissions.

------------------------------------------------
Deleting a researcher's organization permissions
------------------------------------------------
Navigate to `Manage Organization` https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/researchers/. Only users with organization admin and organization read permissions can view other researchers in the org.  Click "Remove" beside the
researcher you wish to delete, and then click "Remove" again in the confirmation modal.  The researcher will be marked as inactive and will no longer be permitted to login to Experimenter.
