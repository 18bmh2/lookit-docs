Logging in
##################################

Usual login process
--------------------------------------

1. To log in to Lookit as a researcher, go to either:

  * `<https://lookit-staging.mit.edu/exp/>`_ (for the staging server)
  * `<https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/>`_ (for the production server)

  There is also a "Researcher login" link at the bottom of the respective Lookit home page that will take you here. (Don't use the regular "Login" link at the top! Your researcher password won't work.)

2. Click on 'Open Science Framework' to log in using your OSF account:

3. You will be prompted to enter your OSF credentials:

.. admonition:: How do participants log in?

   The "Login" link at the top right of the Lookit site is for (non-researcher) participants. You can register children and participate using your researcher account, but  you may prefer to make a separate participant account to actually participate with your kids. You can do so by logging out and clicking the "Sign up" button. You'll need to use a different email address than your OSF account uses.

First time logging in?
--------------------------------------

1. Follow steps 1 and 2 above. When you see the prompt for OSF credentials in step 3, you may need to make an Open Science Framework (OSF) account:

  * For the **staging** Lookit server, you will need a **staging OSF** account, which you probably don't already have. Register for one using the "Create Account" link.

  * For the **production** Lookit server, you will use a regular OSF account. You may already have one if you have have used OSF for preregistration or file storage, or you can create one from the "Create Account" link. 

2. Return to the Lookit experimenter login screen at `<https://lookit-staging.mit.edu/exp/>`_ (staging) or `<https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/>`_ (production), and enter your (staging) OSF credentials. 

3. You should now see a message that 'Your request to join Experimenter has been submitted' like below. **Please tell us that you have requested access** so we can approve you promptly! We are not notified otherwise, and need to approve you manually (quick and easy, but not automatic).

.. admonition:: What if I'm running Lookit locally for development?

   If running Lookit locally, you will instead need to authenticate through the admin interface as described in `Setup for custom frame development`_.
