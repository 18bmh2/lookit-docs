Logging in

Researchers should log into Experimenter via oauth through the Open Science Framework. Visit `<https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/>`_ to log in to the production server, or `<https://staging-lookit.cos.io/exp/>`_ to log in to the staging server, and click on 'Open Science Framework'. (Note: if running Lookit locally, you will instead need to authenticate as described in `Setup for custom frame development`_.)

We use regular OSF accounts (you already have one if you have used OSF) for the production server, and staging OSF accounts (you probably don't have one yet) for the staging server. A staging OSF account is just an account on OSF's own staging server, where they try out changes ahead of deploying to production. 

If you don't have the appropriate type of OSF account yet, you can register to create one (use the 'Create Account' link on the screen shown below). Once you have an account, return to the Lookit experimenter login screen at `<https://lookit.mit.edu/exp/>`_ or `<https://staging-lookit.cos.io/exp/>`_, click 'Open Science Framework' again, and enter your credentials.

If you have not previously logged in to Lookit (or Lookit staging), you should now see a message that 'Your request to join Experimenter has been submitted. You will receive a notification by email when this is completed.' **Please tell us** once you have requested access so we can approve you promptly! New researchers require approval to access Lookit, which is easy (one of us clicking a button) but not automatic.

Otherwise, you will be now be logged into Experimenter.

Researcher accounts can also have children and demographic data, just like participants. If you would like to have a **separate** participant account on Lookit for testing and/or actual participation, use a different email address and sign up for an account using the 'Sign up' link on the home page.
