Welcome! Here you will find detailed information about how to design and run online research studies with families on Lookit.

If you're new to Lookit, the best way to get up to speed quickly is to work through the :ref:`tutorial<Tutorial>`.

.. admonition:: Can I use it yet?

   We are planning to allow researchers to collect data on Lookit starting June 29th, 2020! We are working as fast as we can to make the platform available to everyone. Currently, a limited number of collaborative studies from beta testers are taking place, and a growing community of researchers is preparing studies on our staging server to start as soon as possible. You can learn more about the launch timeline on `the wiki <https://github.com/lookit/research-resources/wiki>`_ or by looking through `Lookit platform projects <https://github.com/orgs/lookit/projects>`_.
   
**Preparing to use Lookit in the future:**
   
- To run a study on Lookit, you will first need to get an access agreement signed and start an IRB proposal as described `in the wiki <https://github.com/lookit/research-resources/wiki/IRB-and-legal-information>`_. This is something you can go ahead and set up ahead of time - in fact, we encourage trying to get the access agreement signed ASAP, as it should only take a few minutes of your time to kick off that process but it may take a while for your institution to get it back to you.

- Some background reading: **Please make sure you have actually read the** `Terms of Use <https://lookit.mit.edu/termsofuse/>`_. There's a bit of legal boilerplate in there, but the bulk is meaningful content about precautions you need to take to protect participant privacy, restrictions on protocols that can be run on Lookit, and what data you (and Lookit) can use and publish. It's important that as the researcher using the platform you actually understand and agree to these terms. 

- Do go ahead and work through the tutorial so you're ready to hit the ground running!

- Start preparing the details of your study! This is relatively non-technical (but surprisingly time-consuming).

   - **Study protocol:** In our experience, the difference between feeling that you've completely planned out your study protocol and having **actually** hashed out all the details can be surprisingly large. Try creating an outline of how you'd like your study to work; you can reference the `the sample list <https://lookit.readthedocs.io/en/develop/researchers-create-experiment.html#a-lookit-study-schema-general-principles-and-instructions>`_ of experiment frames. Make a diagram of how images or video are shown on the page during test trials, including how they are scaled (or not) depending on screen resolution. If you want to play audio or videos, note what triggers them to stop and start, whether they have to complete before something else can happen, etc. Describe any condition assignment and counterbalancing structure in enough detail that you would be happy to replicate the study if it were someone else's. If what should happen next in the experiment depends on participant responses, make sure you cover all the possible responses. 
   - `Create all of the stimuli you'll need <researchers-prep-stimuli.html>`_!
   - Write the text of your study description, prepare a thumbnail image, etc. following  `the descriptions of each item you'll need to prepare <researchers-set-study-fields.html>`_. 
   - Write the text of any study overview, instructions, and debriefing as described `here <researchers-create-experiment.html#a-lookit-study-schema-general-principles-and-instructions>`_.
