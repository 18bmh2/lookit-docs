Welcome to Lookit's documentation!
==========================================

Use the table of contents at the left to navigate. Here you will find information about how to use Lookit to conduct developmental research, as well as how to contribute to the codebase. If you are looking for non-technical information like how to recruit partipants or when the platform will be available for general use, see `the wiki <https://github.com/lookit/research-resources/wiki>`_.

What is Lookit?
----------------
Lookit is an online platform for developmental research. Families can sign up or log in, provide some basic information about their children, and then take part in studies from a variety of labs when it's convenient for them. 

There's no videoconferencing or scheduling: parents and children simply do activities in the web browser, and information about the session (e.g., survey responses, timing, condition assignment) along with webcam video of the session is sent to the Lookit server. 

Lookit can be used to collect looking measures from preverbal children as well as verbal responses, pointing, etc. from older children. Researchers can design, test, and manage their studies on the platform, including contacting participants; common tasks such as checking for informed verbal consent before accessing any data from a session are built into the Lookit research workflow. 

Families may take part in studies from multiple labs over time. Having one central platform allows families to access many interesting studies for all the children in their family in one place, and researchers benefit from economies of scale in software development and recruitment. 

.. admonition:: Can I use it yet?

   We are planning to allow researchers to collect data on Lookit starting June 29th, 2020!  We are working as fast as we can to make the platform available to everyone. Currently, a limited number of collaborative studies from beta testers are taking place, and a growing community of researchers is preparing studies on our staging server to start as soon as possible. You can learn more about the launch timeline on `the wiki <https://github.com/lookit/research-resources/wiki>`_ or by looking through `Lookit platform projects <https://github.com/orgs/lookit/projects>`_.
