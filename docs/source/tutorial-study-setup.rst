Setting up a study - writing and testing out protocol

    Give everyone read access to a few tutorial studies; have them clone these
    Cloning study, build dependencies, previewing
    Changing frame parameters/sequence & seeing on preview
        Reorder the sequence
        Change the text in the intro
        Add another frame
        Using developer tools in your browser: “Break” the sequence, put something there you haven’t defined
    Looking something up in docs
        A few exercises (straightforward questions to answer by using docs) w/ click-to-reveal answers & screenshots
    Exercises
        Substituting in different stimuli
        Making 6 test trial frames instead of 1
        Adding survey questions
        Adding an observation frame
        Counterbalancing/condition assignment
        Conditional dependence
    Communicating with parents (instructions, debriefing, etc.)
        Too much text (instructions): pare it down or spread it out
        Debriefing (uninformative)
        Overview (too technical)
        Make this section a Google form and collect answers??
    Updating the code used (try it out)
    Adding someone else to your study (try it out)
